  {title: "The Trick With Glasses", text: "<p>We all need self-love in a decent dose. To help you with that, I’ve compiled you a list of the 70 best quotes you can ever read on self-love. Keep them close to you, and refer to them whenever you need to.\n\n“You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love & affection.” – Thanissaro Bhikkhu\n“Self-love has very little to do with how you feel about your outer self. It’s about accepting all of yourself.” – Tyra Banks\n“To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don’t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.” – Thich Nhat Hanh\n“To love yourself right now, just as you are, is to give yourself heaven. Don’t wait until you die. If you wait, you die now. If you love, you live now.” – Alan Cohen\n“It is not love that should be depicted as blind, but self-love.” — Voltaire\n“Never bend your head. Always hold it high. Look the world straight in the face.” – Helen Keller\n“When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life.” – Jean Shinoda Bolen\n“What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson\n“Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are.” – Malcolm S. Forbes\n“It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves.” – Edmund Hillary\n“Embrace the glorious mess that you are.” – Elizabeth Gilbert\n\n<p>“Loving yourself…does not mean being self-absorbed or narcissistic, or disregarding others. Rather it means welcoming yourself as the most honored guest in your own heart, a guest worthy of respect, a lovable companion.” – Margot Anand\n“I think the most important thing in life is self-love, because if you don’t have self-love, and respect for everything about your own body, your own soul, your own capsule, then how can you have an authentic relationship with anyone else?” – Shailene Woodley\n“I think everybody’s weird. We should all celebrate our individuality and not be embarrassed or ashamed of it.” – Johnny Depp\n“You can’t build joy on a feeling of self-loathing.” – Ram Dass\n“Whatever you are doing, love yourself for doing it. Whatever you are feeling, love yourself for feeling it.” – Thaddeus Golas\n“A lot of times, in our culture and our society, we put romantic love somehow on a higher plane than self-love and friendship love. You can’t do that. You have to honor and really fully invest in all these different loving relationships.” – Delilah\n“Self-love is the source of all our other loves.” — Pierre Corneille\n“Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one’s definition of your life, but define yourself.” – Harvey Fierstein</p>\n“If you aren’t good at loving yourself, you will have a difficult time loving anyone, since you’ll resent the time and energy you give another person that you aren’t even giving to yourself.” – Barbara De Angelis\n“Our first and last love is self-love.” – Christian Nestell Bovee</p>", user_id: 1, image_url: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/2589653/pexels-photo-2589653.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"},
  {title: "FRIEND, Take your First Steps today", text: "<p>Our hair grows in a cycle with three distinct phases.</p>\n\nFirst, hair grows and gets longer in the anagen phase which can go on for several years. Then, during the ~10-day catagen phase, hair stops actively growing and separates from its follicle, which is what holds the hair in place beneath the skin. Finally, in the telogen phase, the follicle goes into rest mode for several months until the hair falls out. Then, the process starts anew.\n\nThe average person loses 50 to 100 hairs per day naturally due to this cycle. But if the process is interrupted at any stage—for example, if the follicle doesn’t come back out of resting mode or starts to shrink—hair loss and hair thinning can result. Interruptions to the cycle can be caused by hormones, stress, poor diet, chemical hair treatments, certain medications, and, of course, good ol' genetics.", user_id: 1, image_url: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1172207/pexels-photo-1172207.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"},

And while some men are lucky enough to age with a lush head of hair intact, most experience some balding.</p>\n\n<p>Roughly two-thirds of men will experience some degree of hair loss by the time they reach 35 years of age. By the age of 50, 85 percent of men have significantly thinning hair. Shockingly, one out of four men will suffer baldness before they reach 21.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, balding isn’t an isolated issue that you’re dealing with on your own.

  {title: "HAir Loss Tips", text: "<p>At age 18, John figured out he was balding from a photo on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Growing up, John -- a millennial Seattle-based public relations professional who asked that we withhold his real name -- prided himself on his luscious locks. “I had always had a thick, full head of hair -- I’m of Middle Eastern/Jewish ancestry,” he says. “That was closely associated with my identity.” But as a freshman in college, he discovered that he was losing his hair when a friend posted a photo of him on Facebook. “I was kind of stunned. It was really brutal,” he says, noting it was the thinning hair around his temples that gave it away. “I just assumed [balding] was something that magically happened at 45.”</p>\n\n<p>For Mabel it was a clogged shower drain that alerted her to the problem. Already stressed by the pressures of college (she was a premed major and had picked up a minor), and feeling homesick for her family in Hawaii, Mabel, then 19, says the hair loss was devastating. “I thought, oh my god, am I really losing my hair,” she says. “It was crushing.
